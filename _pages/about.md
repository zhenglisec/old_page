I am currently a postdoc at [CISPA Helmhltz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), supervised by [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained my PhD (2023) degree from [CISPA Helmhltz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/) under the supervision of [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). I received my bachelor (2017) and master (2020) degrees from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shanqing Guo](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/guoshanqing/zh_CN/index.htm).

## Research Interests

My research centers on Trustworthy Machine Learning (Privacy, Security, and Safety), especially analyzing machine learning model vulnerabilities, including privacy attacks (MIA and AIA), backdoors, and data poison attacks. Additionally, I work on technical solutions against unethical AI systems.
