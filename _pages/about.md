I am a postdoc at [CISPA Helmhltz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/), hosted by [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained my PhD (2023) degree from [CISPA Helmhltz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/) under the supervision of [Dr. Yang Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/). I received my bachelor (2017) and master (2020) degrees from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shanqing Guo](https://faculty.sdu.edu.cn/guoshanqing/zh_CN/index.htm).

## Research Interests

My general research interest is Trustworthy Machine Learning (Privacy, Security, and Safety); Most of my work has concentrated on analyzing the vulnerability of machine learning models to various attacks, e.g., privacy attacks (MIA and AIA)), backdoor attacks and data poison attacks.
